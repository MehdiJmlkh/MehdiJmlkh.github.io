I’m Mehdi Jamalkhah, a senior computer engineering student at the University of Tehran. My research interests include Large Language Models, Deep Generative Models, Compositional Generalization, and Trustworthy Machine Learning. I am currently working on my bachelor’s thesis, which focuses on evaluating and enhancing creativity in large language models, supervised by [Prof. Yadollah Yaghoobzadeh](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/~y.yaghoobzadeh).
